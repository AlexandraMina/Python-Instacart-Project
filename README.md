_Note: Instacart is a real company that's made their data available online. However, the contents of this project brief have been fabricated for the purpose of the Career Foundry Data Analytics course_

**OBJECTIVE**

The main goal is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of Instacart data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation and target marketing campaigns.



**CONTEXT**

Instacart assume that an one-size-fits all approach isn't the best. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products.



**KEY QUESTIONS**

● The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.

● They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.

● Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.

● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.

● The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:

i) What's the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacrt)?

ii) Are there differencies in ordering habits based on a customer's loyalty status?

iii) Are there differencies in ordering habits based on a customer's region?

iv) Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?

v) What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?

vi) What differences can you find in ordering habits of different custoner profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.


**DATA**

The dataset includes:
- orders data
- orders_products_prior data
- products data
- customers data
- departments data

_Note: The customer data set and column 'prices' were added to the original data set for learning purposes of the Career Foundry Data Analytics course_


**TOOLS**

The Instacart data was analysed using Python and the following libraries:
- Pandas: for the analysis
- Numpy: for mathematical equations
- SciPy: for mathematical equations
- Seaborn: for data visualization
- Matplotlib: for data visualization


**FOLDERS**

The project is organized with the following struture:

    ● 01 Project Management, contains project brief
    
    ● 02 Data, not uploaded to GitHub due to size. This folder has 2 subfolders: Original data and Prepared data
    
    ● 03 Scripts, contains the Jupyter notebooks coded for the analysis
    
    ● 04 Analysis: contains the visualizations used for developing and explaining insights
    
    ● 05 Sent to cliente, contains the final report in Excel
