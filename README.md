**OBJECTIVE**

The main goal is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of Instacart data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation and target marketing campaigns.



**CONTEXT**

Instacart assume that an one-size-fits all approach isn't the best. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products.



**KEY QUESTIONS**

● The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.

● They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
